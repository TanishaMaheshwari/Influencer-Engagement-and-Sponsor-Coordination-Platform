# Influencer-Engagement-and-Sponsor-Coordination-Platform

It is a platform designed to connect sponsors and influencers, enabling sponsors to advertise their products or services while providing influencers with opportunities for monetary benefit.

The application allows both influencers and sponsors to register and interact with each other seamlessly.
I. Registration: Both influencers and sponsors can create accounts on Collabify.
II. Campaign Management: Sponsors have the ability to create and manage advertising campaigns and ad requests.
III. Application Process: Influencers can view these campaigns, check the sponsor they were created by and apply to participate.
IV. Approval and Payment: Once an application is approved, the sponsor pays the influencer as per the agreed terms.
V. Administrative Oversight: An admin dashboard provides a summary of activities by sponsors and influencers. The admin has the capability to flag and remove influencers or sponsors if necessary, ensuring the integrity and proper functioning of the platform.
